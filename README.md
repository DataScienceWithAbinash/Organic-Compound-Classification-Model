# Organic-Compound-Classification-Model
A deep learning model to classify organic compounds

## Dataset
The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds.

## Business Goal
To build a classification model using the given data which is able to predict whether the compound's category is Musk or Non-Musk.

## Approach
Deep Learning approach(Multi-Layer Perceptron)

## Output contains
1.	A detailed report of the model
2.	The trained h5 model
3.	The Loss and Accuracy graphs in the proper format (Both Training and Validation)
4.	Final performance measures of the model including validation accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score
